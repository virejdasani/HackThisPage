#### I made a browser extension called "Hack This Page" with which you can edit or 'hack' any website with ease. 
(Download links at the end of the post)

>#### Let me show you what I'm talking about:

![Virej-140M subscribers-youtube](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajzcku4pvg74sw93m6d2.png) 

- Yes, I did give myself more subscribers than PewDiePie and a video with 4 Billion views
- And no, I didn't use the developer tools (inspect element, etc.)


>### So how did I do it?


Essentially, once you add the extension and click the hack button, you can edit webpages like a text document without ever opening the developer tools!

This makes it very easy to use to prank your friends and requires no programming skills


#### This is how easily you can hack any website!
